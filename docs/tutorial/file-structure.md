# File structure

The basic file structure of a Quyckplot project is as follows:

```
my-project/
├── data/
│   ├── data1.csv
│   ├── data2.txt
│   └── data3.xls
├── script1.py
└── script2.py
```

Of course, you can give any name to your data folder and scripts. You can also have as many data folders as you want including none at all (i.e having all your data in the same folder as your scripts). However, it is recommended to have a separate folder for your data. In this tutorial, we will assume that your data is in a folder called `data`.
